1) Create a simple spring application which will have a DAO known as UserRatingDAO
   and configure it as a bean in spring container and will have 4 below dependencies
   like driver,url,user,password and will be injected using setter based injection and 
   values should be picked from jdbc.properties file.
   
   And simple will display DB info using a info method. Do not connect to DB 
   at the moment.
