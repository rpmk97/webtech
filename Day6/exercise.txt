2) Write a program to hold 10 cars objects and display them sorted and make 
   sure no duplicate car objects are there.
   Each car will have below properties :
   
   int vin
   String model
   String make
   double price
   int speed

   Requirements :
   		a) Display car objects sorted by price
   		b) Display car objects sorted by make
   		c) Display car objects sorted by vin and price both in ascending order using 
   		   custom comparator
   		
3) Write a program to hold 20 cars object wherein application should allow to keep 
   the cars by their ranking and ranking is decided by which cars are highest sold 
   cars till now in the history for a particular model. And while displaying them on 
   console, cars with high ranking should be on top.
   
   Ranking conditions :
   
   cars sold greater then 50000 = Rank 5 (Highest Rank)
   cars sold greater then 40000 = Rank 4
   cars sold greater then 30000 = Rank 3
   cars sold greater then 25000 = Rank 2
   cars sold greater then 500 = Rank 1 (Lowest Rank)
