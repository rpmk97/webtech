1) Write a program which will calculate the square of numbers from 10 to 500
   and will display only those results which are divisible by 10;

2) Write a program which will generate unique and random numbers for some 
   sequencing purposes in such a way that those use cases which need number
   in 4 digit range should get it, and where 6 digit numbers are required 
   should get it and so on and so on. And should allow to generate numbers
   with custom ranges also. You have a to design a function like that so 
   that can fulfill this requirement as a single function.
